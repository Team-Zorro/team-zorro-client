### SSERPDROW
We were tasked with creating an application where users(companies/organizations)can create web pages and blogposts. Visitors can view all web pages and blog posts for all companies without logging in.

# Team Prompt :
Build an application for Swedish web-conglomerate Sserpdrow! Your application's "users" will be companies/organizations that want to have their own company blog and web pages and they are going to use your application to CRUD their own "blog posts" and "web pages". When a user logs in, they should see a dashboard that lets them CRUD their "blog posts" and "web pages". Your application will also likely have “visitors” that just go to your site and want to consume (read) the content that your “users” (companies/organizations) have provided. When a "visitor" goes to your site, they should be shown a list of companies/organizations to view.

After a user signs in to Sserpdrow they can create websites and blog posts.

# Unsolved Problems
In a future iteration of this app we would have included making CSS changes to websites such as allowing
the user to modify the font color, font-family and background. For the most part, we ran out of time and were unable to include this feature in the application.

# Development Process

First we began with a planning meeting, where we discussed the project prompt and created user stories. We also created ERDs (Entity Relationship Diagrams) and sketched out wireframes. We frequently came back to our planning resources and re-factored when we hit obstacles or decided we wanted to change the expected parameters.
Throughout the development process, we troubleshooted through error after error as a team and we found that working through errors and debugging as a team was much easier than doing it alone.
